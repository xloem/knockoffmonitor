The frequency spectrums of these are: 

Delta(δ) 1-4Hz 
Theta(θ) 4-8Hz 
Alpha(α) 7.5-13Hz 
Beta(β) 13-30Hz 
Gamma(γ) 30-44Hz

    <string name="help_algorithms1">Algorithms - These are experimental algorithms based on \"My Virtual Dream\": Collective Neurofeedback in an Immersive Art Environment by Natasha Kovacevic, Petra Ritter, William Tays, Sylvain Moreno, Anthony Randal McIntosh, which can be found here:</string>
    <string name="help_algorithms2">"Mellow - Based on the Relative Spectral Power (RSP) of Alpha.
\"This value goes up when you are relaxing, letting go of judgement, letting go of trying to control things, letting go of attachment to outcome, not thinking about anything with a goal, or being without an active task. You are not engaged in strenuous mental processing but still alert to your senses. A ready, waiting state.\" 

Concentration - Based on the RSP of Gamma.
\"This value goes up when you are focusing on something particular, thinking about something with intensity, concentrating on something, waiting in expectation for something to happen, trying to solve a problem, or working your intellectual mind.\" 

Interaxon originally included these in their SDK, but removed them on April 5th, 2016, stating \"We have removed these values from the SDK because we do not believe they reflect the quality of experience that we would like our users to have\". 

I have implemented my own version of these algorithms based on my personal interpretation of the original research paper. 

These algorithms both work in the same way. First there is a settling in period of a few seconds to make sure that the headband is correctly on the head (only TP9 and TP10 are used). Next there is a training period, during which the mean RSP is monitored. From this mean point minimum and maximum trigger points are set. After this, any deviation outside of the minimum:maximum training range will cause a fixed delta to the algorithm value."</string>

Use two finger pinch to zoom in/out and a single finger touch to pan up/down. 

The granularity of the data in this view will depend on the number of raw data samples used, this is called the FFT Window. 

[FFT window] is adjustable in [Settings]. Note that high values will take much more processing power.

    <string name="help_raw">"Raw - Raw EEG values show each sensors raw data in microvolts(μV), the range of which is {0:~1682}. 

The [Vertical Max] is adjustable in [Settings], or by using two finger pinch to zoom in/out. Note that the graph will automatically center vertically, so for example a set of readings between {800μV:900μV} would be entirely visible with a vertical scale of 100μV selected. 
The sensors are: 

TP9 - Left ear 
AF7 - Left forehead 
AF8 - Right forehead 
TP10 - Right ear 
AUXR - Right Auxiliary (MU-02 only) 

Note that the position of AF7 and AF8 will depend on head size. On other heads, these may be closer to FP1 and FP2. 

Auxiliary electrodes (enabled via [Settings] - [Show Aux Input]) can be connected on the Muse micro USB connector, by pin 4 on the MU-02 (BlueTooth LE) model. 

By default a notch frequency filter of 60Hz for standard US,Canada power, will be applied to raw values. This can be changed via [Settings] - [Advanced Settings] - [Notch Filter] to 50Hz, or disabled."</string>
    <string name="help_recording1">"Recorded files are saved by default as plain text CSV (comma separated values) format, with data being recorded approximately every second.

Recording data to Muse Player compatible protocol buffer format is also supported via [Settings] - [Recording Format] - [Muse]. 

When using this format it is recommended to set [Settings] - [Recording Interval] - [Constant]. This will create approximately 256 data points per second for RAW values, or ~10/sec for absolute. 

To play back the Muse file, run MuseLab. Select \"UDP\" and enter \"5000\" for the port number. Click \"Open Port\". 
This makes MuseLab listen on port UDP5000 for incoming data. 

Next run Muse Player. Use the \"-f\" option first to specify the input file and then \"-s\" to direct the output stream. 
The command will look like this: muse-player -f musedata.muse -s osc.udp://localhost:5000 

You can now go back to MuseLab and select \"Visualizers\" - \"New\" - \"Scrolling Line Graph\" - \"Finish\" 
Then put a checkbox next to all the data types you wish to display.
